/// For full details on this, see the "Buffer Object Streaming" page on the Khronos OpenGL
/// Wiki (https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Buffer_Object_Streaming). In particular, note
/// the section on "Buffer Update". 
/// In short, this is what we do:
/// - We create a buffer of a fixed size (8MB, for example), with the StreamDraw usage
/// - Each time we want to make a DrawArrays call, we call glMapBufferRange with the 
///   GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT. This tells OpenGL not to do any synchronization _at all_.
///   We're telling OpenGL: "Please give me write access to a region of this buffer immediately.
///   I promise not to overwrite any of the areas you might still be reading / executing."
/// - We maintain a 'cursor' into this buffer, initially at 0. Each time we write, we advance
///   the cursor by the size of data written (rounding up to 64, which is the minimum size GL
///   needs to maintain UNSYNCHRONIZED access). 
/// - If the fresh data we need to write is too big to fit into the remaining space (8MB - cursor),
///   we simply 'orphan' this buffer (by calling BufferData with the same size, and passing NULL).
///   This tells OpenGL: allocate a fresh 8MB for me to write in, while you can continue reading from
///   the previous data allocated for this buffer. When we Orphan, we set cursor back to 0 and start
///   writing from the start of this fresh new buffer we got. 
/// - Eventually, there will be a few 8MB buffers 'in flight' with data we've written but which
///   OpenGL is still rendering. Since all the buffers are exactly the same size, it makes it very
///   easy for the driver to optimize it's heap management and we are usually going to get to a 
///   steady state soon where there are N 8MB buffers continuously being rotated between the CPU
///   and the GPU. 
/// In practice, this is really efficient and we are getting frame rates (even with a very large
/// number of small draw primitives) that are well beyond what even the Flux rendering engine can
/// manage. 
/// Note: The ShaderWrap classes add another level of optimization on top of this StreamBuffer.
